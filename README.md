# SAP Capgemini QA

2019 SAP Praktikum - Capgemini Quality Assurance Project

Short Documentation:
* **keys.py** contains all keys. These should be dev keys, to be removed before we make the repository public.
* **ml_interface.py** contains the client class for the ML callbacks. You can see how this client is supposed to work in **requests.ipynb**. This one is specifically for the Machine Learning API, we will most likely need a similar one for the database one as well.
